# Unit 23: Generics

!!! abstract "Learning Objectives"

    After this unit, students should be able to:

    - define and use generic classes and generic methods with appropriate type parameters;
    - distinguish clearly between type parameters, type arguments, and parameterized types;
    - explain how generics enforce compile-time type safety and eliminate certain classes of runtime errors;
    - apply bounded type parameters to constrain permissible operations on type variables;
    - reason about how generics reduce code duplication while preserving static typing guarantees.

!!! info "Overview"

    In earlier units, we saw how polymorphism allows us to write general code that works for many types, often by treating objects uniformly as Object or through interfaces. While flexible, this approach can sacrifice type precision and shift certain errors from compile time to runtime.

    This unit introduces generics, a language mechanism that allows us to write reusable and abstract code without giving up static type safety. By parameterizing classes and methods with types, we let the compiler track and enforce relationships between values, preventing common mistakes such as invalid casts. Generics form a key bridge between abstraction and safety in Java, and understanding them is essential for reasoning about correctness in larger systems.

## The `Pair` class

Sometimes it is useful to have a lightweight class to bundle a pair of variables together.  One could, for instance, write a method that returns two values.  The example defines a class `IntPair` that bundles two `int` variables together. This is a utility class with no semantics or methods associated with it.  So, we did not attempt to hide the implementation details.

```Java title="A Pair of Integer"
class IntPair {
  private int first;
  private int second;

  public IntPair(int first, int second) {
    this.first = first;
    this.second = second;
  }

  int getFirst() {
    return this.first;
  }

  int getSecond() {
    return this.second;
  }
}
```

This class can be used, for instance, in a function that returns two `int` values.

```Java title="Finding Minimum and Maximum"
IntPair findMinMax(int[] array) {
  int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;  // stores the min
  int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;  // stores the max
  for (int i : array) {
    if (i < min)  {
      min = i;
    }
    if (i > max) {
      max = i;
    }
  }
  return new IntPair(min, max);
}
```

We could similarly define a pair class for two doubles (`DoublePair`), two booleans (`BooleanPair`), etc.  In other situations, it is useful to define a pair class that bundles two variables of two different types, say, a `Customer` and a `ServiceCounter`; a `String` and an `int`; etc.  

We should not, however, create one class for each possible combination of types.  A better idea is to define a class that stores two `Object` references:

```Java title="Pair v0.1 with Object"
class Pair {
  private Object first;
  private Object second;

  public Pair(Object first, Object second) {
    this.first = first;
    this.second = second;
  }

  Object getFirst() {
    return this.first;
  }

  Object getSecond() {
    return this.second;
  }
}
```

At the cost of using a [wrapper class](20-wrapper.md) in place of primitive types, we get a single class that can be used to store any type of value.  

You might recall that we used a similar approach for our [`contains` method](14-polymorphism.md) to implement a general _method_ that works for any type of object.  Here, we are using this approach for a general _class_ that encapsulates any type of object.

Unfortunately, the issues we faced with narrowing type conversion and potential runtime errors apply to the `Pair` class as well.  Suppose that a function returns a `Pair` containing a `String` and an `Integer`, and we accidentally treat this as an `Integer` and a `String` instead, the compiler will not be able to detect the type mismatch and stop the program from crashing during runtime.

```Java title="Potential Issue with Pair of Object"
Pair foo() {
  return new Pair("hello", 4);
}

Pair p = foo();
Integer i = (Integer) p.getFirst(); // runtime ClassCastException
```

To reduce the risk of human error, what we need is a way to specify the following: suppose the type of `first` is $S$ and type of `second` is $T$, then we want the return type of `getFirst` to be $S$ and of `getSecond` to be $T$.  For this to be useful, we want this "supposition" to be done at compile-time and checked by the compiler when we provide the actual $S$ and $T$ in the code.

## Generic Types

In Java and many other programming languages, the mechanism to do this is called generics or templates.  Java allows us to define a _generic type_ that takes other types as _type parameters_, just like how we can write methods that take in variables as parameters.  

### Declaring a Generic Type

Let's see how we can do this for `Pair`:

```Java title="Pair v0.2 with Generics"
class Pair<S,T> {
  private S first;
  private T second;

  public Pair(S first, T second) {
    this.first = first;
    this.second = second;
  }

  public S getFirst() {
    return this.first;
  }

  public T getSecond() {
    return this.second;
  }
}
```

We declare a generic type by specifying its type parameters between `<` and `>` when we declare the type.  Similar to how the parameters to a method can be used as variables within the method, type parameters can be used as _type variables_ . By convention, we use a single capital letter to name each type variable.  These type variables are scoped within the definition of the generic type.  

In the example above, we have a generic class `Pair<S,T>` (read "pair of S and T")  with `S` and `T` as type parameters.  This declaration of generic class also declares `S` and `T` as type variables. We can then use `S` and `T` as the type of the fields `first` and `second`.  We ensure that `getFirst()` returns type `S` and `getSecond()` returns type `T`, so that the compiler will give an error if we mix up the types.

Note that the constructor for `Pair` is still declared as `Pair` (without the type parameters).

Just like a variable must be declared before it is used, a type variable must be declared as a type parameter before it is used.  For instance, the following would result in a compilation error:

```Java title="Undeclared Type Parameter"
class A {
  T x; // compilation error: T not declared
}
```

Here is a summary of the two approaches towards writing generic code: 

| Aspect | Using `Object` | Using Generics |
|-------|----------------|---------------|
| Type checking | Runtime | Compile time |
| Casts required | Yes | No |
| Risk of `ClassCastException` | High | Eliminated |
| Code readability | Lower | Higher |
| Compiler assistance | Minimal | Strong |

Generics allow us to encode relationships between types directly in method and class definitions, so that the compiler, not the programmer, checks these relationship.

### Using/Instantiating a Generic Type

To use a generic type, we have to pass in _type arguments_, which itself can be a non-generic type, a generic type, or another type parameter that has been declared.  Once a generic type is instantiated, it is called a _parameterized type_.

To avoid human errors that could lead to the runtime error of `ClassCastException` in the example above, we can use the generic version of `Pair` as follows, taking in two non-generic types:

```Java title="Compile-Time Error with Generic Pair"
Pair<String,Integer> foo() {
  return new Pair<String,Integer>("hello", 4);
}

Pair<String,Integer> p = foo();
Integer i = (Integer) p.getFirst(); // compile-time error
```

With the parameterized type `Pair<String,Integer>`, the return type of `getFirst` is bound to `String`, and the compiler now has enough type information to check and give us an error since we try to cast a `String` to an `Integer`.

Note that we use `Integer` instead of `int`, since _only reference types_ can be used as type arguments.

Just like you can pass a parameter of a method as argument to another method, we can pass the type parameter of a generic type as type argument to another generic type:

```Java title="Extending Generic Type"
class DictEntry<T> extends Pair<String, T> {
    :
}
```

We define a generic class called `DictEntry<T>` with a single type parameter `T` that extends from `Pair<String,T>`, where `String` is the first type argument (in place of `S`), while the type parameter `T` from `DictEntry<T>` is passed as the type argument for `T` of `Pair<String,T>`.  Now, if we want a dictionary entry that maps a `String` to an `Integer`, we can use the parameterized type `DictEntry<Integer>`.

### Generic Methods

Methods can be parameterized with a type parameter as well.  Consider the `contains` method, which we now put within a class for clarity.

```Java title="contains v0.1 (with Polymorphism)"
class A {
  public static boolean contains(Object[] array, Object obj) {
    for (Object curr : array) {
      if (curr.equals(obj)) {
        return true;
      }
    }
    return false;
  }
}
```

While using this method does not involve narrowing type conversion and type casting, it is a little too general &mdash; it allows us to call `contains` in a nonsensical way, like this:
```Java
String[] strArray = new String[] { "hello", "world" };
A.contains(strArray, 123);
```

Searching for an integer within an array of strings is a futile attempt!  Let's constrain the type of the object to search for to be the same as the type of the array.  We can make this type the parameter to this method:

```Java title="contains v0.5 with Generics"
class A {
  public static <T> boolean contains(T[] array, T obj) {
    for (T curr : array) {
      if (curr.equals(obj)) {
        return true;
      }
    }
    return false;
  }
}
```

The above shows an example of a _generic method_.  The type variable `T` is declared within `<` and `>` and is added before the return type of the method.  This variable `T` is then scoped within the whole method.

To call a generic method, we need to pass in the type argument placed before the name of the method[^1].  For instance,
```Java
String[] strArray = new String[] { "hello", "world" };
A.<String>contains(strArray, 123); // type mismatch error
```

[^1]: Java actually can infer the type using the _type inference_ mechanism and allows us to skip the type argument, but for clarity, we insist on specifying the type explicitly until students get used to the generic types and reasoning about types.

The code above won't compile since the compiler expects the second argument to also be a `String`.

## Bounded Type Parameters

Let's now try to apply our newly acquired trick to fix the issue with `findLargest`.  Recall that we have the following `findLargest` method (which we now put into an ad hoc class just for clarity), which [requires us to perform a narrowing type conversion](21-casting.md) to cast from `GetAreable` and possibly lead to a runtime error.

```Java title="findLargest v0.5 with GetAreable"
class A {
  public static GetAreable findLargest(GetAreable[] array) {
    double maxArea = 0;
    GetAreable maxObj = null;
    for (GetAreable curr : array) {
      double area = curr.getArea();
      if (area > maxArea) {
        maxArea = area;
        maxObj = curr;
      }
    }
    return maxObj;
  }
}
```

Let's try to make this method generic, by forcing the return type to be the same as the type of the elements in the input array,

```Java title="findLargest v0.6 with Generics (Won't Compile)"
class A {
  public static <T> T findLargest(T[] array) {
    double maxArea = 0;
    T maxObj = null;
    for (T curr : array) {
      double area = curr.getArea();
      if (area > maxArea) {
        maxArea = area;
        maxObj = curr;
      }
    }
    return maxObj;
  }
}
```

The code above won't compile, since the compiler cannot be sure that it can find the method `getArea()` in type `T`.  In contrast, when we run `contains`, we have no issue since we are invoking the method `equals`, which exists in any reference type in Java.

Since we intend to use `findLargest` only in classes that implement the `GetAreable` interface and support the `getArea()` method, we can put a constraint on `T`.  We can say that `T` must be a subtype of `GetAreable` when we specify the type parameter:

```Java title="findLargest v0.7 with Generics and Bounded Type Parameter" hl_lines="2"
class A {
  public static <T extends GetAreable> T findLargest(T[] array) {
    double maxArea = 0;
    T maxObj = null;
    for (T curr : array) {
      double area = curr.getArea();
      if (area > maxArea) {
        maxArea = area;
        maxObj = curr;
      }
    }
    return maxObj;
  }
}
```

We use the keyword `extends` here to indicate that `T` must be a subtype of `GetAreable`.  It is unfortunate that Java decides to use the term `extends` for any type of subtyping when declaring a bounded type parameter, even if the supertype (such as `GetAreable`) is an interface.

We can use bounded type parameters for declaring generic classes as well.  For instance, Java has a generic interface `Comparable<T>`, which dictates the implementation of the following `int compareTo(T t)` for any concrete class that implements the interface.   Any class that implements the `Comparable<T>` interface can be compared with an instance of type `T` to establish an ordering.  Such ordering can be useful for sorting objects, for instance.

Suppose we want to compare two `Pair` instances, by comparing the first element in the pair, we could do the following:

```Java title="Pair v0.3 with Generics and Bounded Type Parameters" hl_lines="1 18-21"
class Pair<S extends Comparable<S>,T> implements Comparable<Pair<S,T>> {
  private S first;
  private T second;

  public Pair(S first, T second) {
    this.first = first;
    this.second = second;
  }

  public S getFirst() {
    return this.first;
  }

  public T getSecond() {
    return this.second;
  }

  @Override
  public int compareTo(Pair<S,T> s1) {
    return this.first.compareTo(s1.first);
  }

  @Override
  public String toString() {
    return this.first + " " + this.second;
  }
}
```

Let's look at what it means:

- We declared `Pair` to be a generic type of two type parameters: the first one `S` is bounded and must be a subtype of `Comparable<S>`.  This bound is self-referential, but it is intuitive &mdash; we say that `S` must be comparable to itself, which is common in many use cases.
- Since we want to compare two `Pair` instances, we maden `Pair` implement the `Comparable` interface too, passing in `Pair<S,T>` as the type argument to `Comparable`.

Let's see this in action with [`Arrays::sort`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/25/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Arrays.html#sort(java.lang.Object%5B%5D)) method, which sorts an array based on the ordering defined by `compareTo`.

```Java
Object[] array = new Object[] {
  new Pair<String,Integer>("Alice", 1),
  new Pair<String,Integer>("Carol", 2),
  new Pair<String,Integer>("Bob", 3),
  new Pair<String,Integer>("Dave", 4),
};

java.util.Arrays.sort(array);

for (Object o : array) {
  System.out.println(o);
}
```

You will see the pairs are sorted by the first element.
