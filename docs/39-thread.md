# Unit 38: Threads

!!! abstract "Learning Objectives"

    After this unit, students should be able to:

    - explain the limitations of synchronous programming and why blocking calls reduce program responsiveness;
    - describe what a thread is and how multiple threads can execute concurrently;
    - create and run simple threads using the `Thread` class and lambda expressions;
    - distinguish between synchronous and asynchronous execution in Java programs;
    - observe and reason about thread execution using thread names and basic thread APIs.

!!! info "Overview"

    In the previous unit, we saw how parallel streams allow us to exploit multiple cores with minimal changes to our code. While convenient, parallel streams give us little control over when and how different parts of a computation run, and they hide many important details of concurrent execution.

    In this unit, we step down one level of abstraction to study threads, the fundamental building blocks of concurrency in Java. Threads allow a program to perform multiple tasks at the same time, such as keeping a user interface responsive while a long-running computation is executing, by decoupling progress from blocking method calls.

    By understanding how threads are created, scheduled, and executed, you will gain a clearer mental model of asynchronous execution. This model will form the foundation for later units, where we learn about coordination in concurrent programs.

## Synchronous Programming

So far, when we invoke a method in Java, we expect the method to return a value when it is done.  If the method is not done, the execution of our program stalls, waiting for the method to complete its execution.  Only after the method returns can the execution of our program continue.

We say that the method _blocks_ until it returns.   Such a programming model is known as _synchronous programming_.

Synchronous programming is not very efficient, especially when there are frequent method calls that block for a long period (such as methods that involve expensive computations or reading from a remote server over the Internet).

What if we want our program to do something while we wait for the method to return?  For instance, refreshing the UI, or performing other computations?

## Threads

One way to achieve this is to use _threads_.  A thread is a single flow of execution in a program.  Since the beginning of this course, we have been writing single-thread programs, except for parallel streams in [Unit 38](38-parallel.md).

Java provides a class called [`java.lang.Thread`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/25/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Thread.html) that we can use to encapsulate a function to run in a separate thread.  The following example showss how we can create and run two threads:

```Java
new Thread(() -> {
  for (int i = 1; i < 100; i += 1) {
    System.out.print("_");
  }
}).start();

new Thread(() -> {
  for (int i = 2; i < 100; i += 1) {
    System.out.print("*");
  }
}).start();
```

The `new Thread(..)` is our usual constructor to create a `Thread` instance.  The constructor takes a `Runnable` instance as an argument.  A `Runnable` is a functional interface with a method `run()` that takes in no parameter and returns `void`.

With each `Thread` instance, we run `start()`, which causes the given lambda expression to run.  Note that `start()` returns immediately.  It _does not wait to return_ until the given lambda expression completes its execution.  This property differs from what we are accustomed to, where a method blocks until the task given is completed.   This is known as _asynchronous_ execution.

The two threads above now run in two separate sequences of execution.  The operating system has a scheduler that decides which threads to run when, and on which core (or which processor).  You might see different interleaving of executions every time you run the same program.

Note that we can only control the order in which we start the threads (by changing the order of `Thread::start` invocation).  We have no control over in what order the threads are run.  The scheduling is done by the operating system. 

Java provides more than one way to create a thread.  The `Thread` class also contains methods that we can use to query and control, in a finer-grained manner, how the thread could be executed.

### Names

Every thread in Java has a name. Printing out a thread's name is useful for inspecting the runtime behavior.  We can use the instance method `getName()` to find out the name of a thread, and the class method `Thread.currentThread()` to get the reference of the current running thread.

```Java hl_lines="1 3 10"
System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName());
new Thread(() -> {
  System.out.print(Thread.currentThread().getName());
  for (int i = 1; i < 100; i += 1) {
    System.out.print("_");
  }
}).start();

new Thread(() -> {
  System.out.print(Thread.currentThread().getName());
  for (int i = 2; i < 100; i += 1) {
    System.out.print("*");
  }
}).start();
```

The code snippet above will also print the name of the thread called `main`, which is a thread created automatically for us every time our program runs and the class method `main()` is invoked.

With this approach, you can now "visualize" how many parallel threads are created when you invoke a parallel stream.

Try
```Java
Stream.of(1, 2, 3, 4)
      .parallel()
      .reduce(0, (x, y) -> { 
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName()); 
        return x + y; 
      });
```

and you will see something like this:
```
main
ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-5
ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-5
ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-9
ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-3
ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-3
ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-3
```

being printed.  This shows four concurrent threads running to reduce the stream of 1, 2, 3, 4 (including `main`).

If you remove the `parallel()` call:

```Java
Stream.of(1, 2, 3, 4)
      .reduce(0, (x, y) -> { 
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName()); 
        return x + y; 
      });
```

then only `main` is printed, showing the reduction being done sequentially in a single thread.

```
main
main
main
main
```

### Sleep

Another useful method in the `Thread` class is `sleep`.  You can cause the current execution thread to pause execution immediately for a given period (in milliseconds).   After the sleep timer is over, the thread is ready to be chosen by the scheduler to run again.

The following code prints a `"."` to the console every second while another expensive computation is running.

```Java
Thread findPrime = new Thread(() -> {
  System.out.println(
	  Stream.iterate(2, i -> i + 1)
          .filter(i -> isPrime(i))
          .limit(1_000_000L)
          .reduce((x, y) -> y)
          .orElse(null));
});

findPrime.start();

while (findPrime.isAlive()) {
  try {
    Thread.sleep(1000);
    System.out.print(".");
  } catch (InterruptedException e) {
    System.out.print("interrupted");
  }
} 
```

In our examples, we often use `Thread.sleep()` in our methods to simulate expensive computations.

Two more things to note:

- The example above shows how we use `isAlive()` to periodically check if another thread is still running.
- The program exits only after all the threads created run to their completion.
