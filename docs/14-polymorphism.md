# Unit 14: Polymorphism

!!! abstract "Learning Objectives"

    After reading this unit, students should be able to:

    - explain polymorphism as runtime method selection based on an object's runtime type;
    - distinguish between compile-time type checking and runtime dynamic method lookup;
    - explain why method overriding requires an identical method signature;
    - correctly override `equals(Object)` and explain why overloading `equals` is insufficient.

!!! info "Overview"

    In the previous units, we have seen how inheritance allows one class to reuse and extend another, and how method overloading enables multiple methods with the same name to coexist based on parameter types. In this unit, we study polymorphism, which brings these ideas together by allowing the same method call to behave differently depending on the runtime type of the object. Polymorphism is what allows object-oriented programs to be extensible, reusable, and robust in the presence of new classes added in the future, often without modifying or even recompiling existing code.

## Taking on Many Forms

Method overriding enables _polymorphism_, the fourth and the final pillar of OOP, and arguably the most powerful one.  It allows us to change how existing code behaves, without changing a single line of the existing code (or even having access to the code).

Consider the function `say(Object)` below:

```Java title="Definition of say"
void say(Object obj) {
  System.out.println("Hi, I am " + obj.toString());
}
```

Note that this method receives an `Object` instance.  Since both `Point` $<:$ `Object` and `Circle` $<:$ `Object`, we can do the following:

```Java title="Invocation of say with Different Type"
Point p = new Point(0, 0);
say(p);
Circle c = new Circle(p, 4);
say(c);
```

When executed, `say` will first print `Hi, I am (0.0, 0.0)`, followed by `Hi, I am { center: (0.0, 0.0), radius: 4.0 }`.  _We are invoking the overriding `Point::toString()` in the first call, and `Circle::toString()` in the second call_.  The same method invocation `obj.toString()` causes two different methods to be called in two separate invocations!

In biology, polymorphism means that an organism can have many different forms.  Here, the variable `obj` can have many "forms" as well, depending on its runtime type.  While the compiler checks whether a method call is legal based on the compile-time type, deciding which method is invoked is done by the Java runtime, _during execution_, as it depends on the runtime type of the `obj`.  The entire mechanism is called _dynamic dispatch_.  This involves dynamic binding and dynamic method lookup.

Before we get into this in more detail, let's consider overriding `Object::equals(Object)`.

## The `equals` method

`Object::equals(Object)` compares if two object references referred to the same object.  Suppose we have:

```Java title="Semantically Equivalent Circle"
Circle c0 = new Circle(new Point(0, 0), 10);
Circle c1 = new Circle(new Point(0, 0), 10);
Circle c2 = c1;
```

`c2.equals(c1)` returns `true`, but `c0.equals(c1)` returns `false`.  Even though `c0` and `c1` are _semantically_ the same, they refer to two different objects.

To compare if two circles are _semantically_ the same, we need to override this method[^1].  After all, Java does not know what it means for two circles to be equal, so we have to define it.

[^1]: If we override `equals()`, we should generally override `hashCode()` as well, but let's leave that for another lesson on another day.

```Java title="Circle v0.7a with Overriding equals" hl_lines="39-49"
/**
 * A Circle object encapsulates a circle on a 2D plane.
 */
class Circle {
  private Point c;   // the center
  private double r;  // the length of the radius

  /**
   * Create a circle centered on Point c with given radius r
   */
  public Circle(Point c, double r) {
    this.c = c;
    this.r = r;
  }

  /**
   * Return the area of the circle.
   */
  public double getArea() {
    return Math.PI * this.r * this.r;
  }

  /**
   * Return true if the given point p is within the circle.
   */
  public boolean contains(Point p) {
    return false;
    // TODO: Left as an exercise
  }

  /**
   * Return the string representation of this circle.
   */
  @Override
  public String toString() {
    return "{ center: " + this.c + ", radius: " + this.r + " }";
  }

  /**
   * Return true the object is the same circle (i.e., same center, same radius).
   */
  @Override
  public boolean equals(Object obj) {
    if (obj instanceof Circle) {
      Circle circle = (Circle) obj;
      return (circle.c.equals(this.c) && circle.r == this.r);
    }
    return false;
  }
}
```

This is more complicated than `toString`.  There are a few new concepts involved here:

- **instanceof Operator:** `equals` takes in a parameter of compile-time type `Object`.  It only makes sense if we compare (during runtime) a circle with another circle.  So, we first check if the runtime type of `obj` is a subtype of `Circle`.  This is done using the `instanceof` operator.  The operator returns `true` if `obj` has a runtime type that is a subtype of `Circle`.

- **Field Access:** To compare `this` circle with the given circle, we have to access the center `c` and radius `r`.  But if we access `obj.c` or `obj.r`, the compiler will complain.  As far as the compiler is concerned, `obj` has the compile-time type `Object`, and there is no such fields `c` and `r` in the class `Object`!  This is why, after assuring that the runtime type of `obj` is a subtype of `Circle`, we assign `obj` to another variable `circle` that has the compile-time type `Circle`.  We finally check if the two centers are equal (again, `Point::equals` is left as an exercise) and if the two radii are equal[^2].

    Recap also that although `c` and `r` are declared with `private` access modifiers, we are accessing from the same class, albeit a   different instance.  This is allowed.

- **Explicit Type Cast:** The statement that assigns `obj` to `circle` involves _type casting_.  We mentioned before that Java is strongly typed, so it is very strict about type conversion.  Here, Java allows type casting from type $T$ to $S$ if $S$ $<:$ $T$. [^3].  This is called _narrowing type conversion_.  Unlike widening type conversion, which is always allowed and always correct, a _narrowing type conversion_ requires explicit type casting and validation during runtime.  If we do not ensure that `obj` has the correct runtime type, casting can lead to a runtime error (which if you [recall](01-compiler.md), is bad).

<!-- - `equals` takes in a parameter of compile-time type `Object`.  It only makes sense if we compare (during runtime) a circle with another circle.

[^2]: The right way to compare two floating-point numbers is to take their absolute difference and check if the difference is small enough.  We are sloppy here to keep the already complicated code a bit simpler.  You shouldn't do this in your code.

[^3]: This is not the only condition where type casting is allowed. We will look at other conditions in later units.

All these complications would go away, however, if we define `Circle::equals` to take in a `Circle` as a parameter, like this:

```Java title="Circle v0.7b with Overriding equals"
class Circle {
    :
  /**
   * Return true the object is the same circle (i.e., same center, same radius).
   */
  @Override
  public boolean equals(Circle circle) {
    return (circle.c.equals(this.c) && circle.r == this.r);
  }
}
```

This version of `equals`, however, does not override `Object::equals(Object)`.  Since we hinted to the compiler that we meant this to be an overriding method, using `@Override`, the compiler will give us an error.  This method is not treated as method overriding, since the method signature for `Circle::equals(Circle)` is different from `Object::equals(Object)`.

Why then is overriding important?  Why should we override `Object::equals(Object)` with `Circle::equals(Object)` and not just overload it with `Circle::equals(Circle)`?

## The Power of Polymorphism

Let's consider the following example.  Suppose we have a general `contains` method that takes in an array of objects.  The array can store any type of object: `Circle`, `Square`, `Rectangle`, `Point`, `String`, etc.  The method `contains` also takes in a target `obj` to search for, and returns true if there is an object in `array` that equals to `obj`.

```Java title="contains v0.1 with Polymorphism" hl_lines="3"
boolean contains(Object[] array, Object obj) {
  for (Object curr : array) {
    if (curr.equals(obj)) {
      return true;
    }
  }
  return false;
}
```

With overriding and polymorphism, the magic happens in Line 3 &mdash; depending on the runtime type of `curr`, the corresponding, customized version of `equals` is called to compare against `obj`.   So if the runtime type of `curr` is `Circle`, then we will invoke `Circle::equals(Object)` and if the runtime type of `curr` is `Point`, then we will invoke `Point::equals(Object)`.  This, of course, assumes that `Object::equals(Object)` is overridden in both classes.

However, if `Circle::equals(Object)` takes in a `Circle` as the parameter, the call to `equals` inside the method `contains` would not invoke `Circle::equals(Circle)`.  It would invoke `Object::equals(Object)` instead due to the matching method signature, and we cannot search for `Circle` based on semantic equality.

Why is this the case?  Look closely at how the method is invoked: `curr.equals(obj)`.  Here, we can see that the parameter we are passing is `obj`.  The _compile-time_ type of `obj` is `Object` as seen from the parameter declaration at Line 2.  So at compile-time, the compiler only know that its type is `Object`, and it can only type-check calls to methods that exist in `Object`. The compiler therefore commits to the method signature `equals(Object)` before the program ever runs.

To have a generic `contains` method without polymorphism and overriding, we will have to do something like this:
```Java title="contains v0.2 without Polymorphism"
boolean contains(Object[] array, Object obj) {
  for (Object curr : array) {
    if (obj instanceof Circle) {
      if (curr.equals((Circle)obj)) {
        return true;
      }
    } else if (obj instanceof Square) {
      if (curr.equals((Square)obj)) {
        return true;
      }
    } else if (obj instanceof Point) {
      if (curr.equals((Point)obj)) {
        return true;
      }
    }
     :
  }
  return false;
}
```

which is not scalable since every time we add a new class, we have to come back to this method and add a new branch to the `if-else` statement!

As this example has shown, polymorphism allows us _to write succinct code that is future-proof_.  By dynamically deciding which method implementation to execute during runtime, the implementer can write short yet very general code that works for existing classes as well as new classes that might be added in the future by the client, without even the need to re-compile.

!!! note "Different Types of Polymorphism"
    The term polymorphism is used in different contexts to mean different things.  In CS2030S, when we refer to the term "polymorphism", we are referring _exclusively_ to, more precisely, _subtype polymorphism_ (also known as inclusion polymorphism). 

    In other literature, you may come across two other types of polymorphism.  Generics ([Unit 24](24-generics.md)) is also called _parametric polymorphism_.  Method overloading ([Unit 13](13-overloading.md)) is sometimes refer to as _ad-hoc polymorphism_.  We don't use these terms in CS2030S.
