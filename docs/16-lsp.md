# Unit 16: Liskov Substitution Principle

!!! abstract "Learning Objectives"

    After this unit, students should be able to:

    - explain why inheritance and method overriding can introduce subtle bugs when client expectations are violated;
    - state the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) and explain it in terms of substitutability and observable behavior;
    - identify violations of LSP by reasoning about method specifications and client assumptions;
    - relate LSP to testing, explaining why subclasses must pass all tests written for their superclasses;
    - use `final` appropriately to prevent unsafe inheritance or overriding when correctness depends on fixed behavior.

!!! info "Overview"

    In the previous units, we saw how polymorphism allows code to be written against abstractions, enabling clients and implementers to evolve independently. We also learned how method overriding lets subclasses customize behavior while preserving a common interface.

    However, with this flexibility comes risk. When inheritance and overriding are used carelessly, they can silently change the behavior of existing code—sometimes without causing any compilation errors. These bugs are often hard to trace, because the client code itself has not changed.

    In this unit, we study the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP), a fundamental rule that governs when inheritance is safe to use. LSP formalizes the idea that a subclass should be usable anywhere its superclass is expected, without breaking existing assumptions. We will see how violating this principle can lead to subtle runtime bugs, how LSP relates to testing and specifications, and how Java provides tools such as `final` to help prevent unsafe inheritance.

## The Responsibility When Using Inheritance

As you have seen in [Unit 14](14-polymorphism.md), polymorphism is a powerful tool that allows a client to change the behavior of existing code written by the implementer, behind the abstraction barrier.

As Ben Parker (aka Uncle Ben) said, "With great power, comes great responsibility."   A developer using inheritance and method overriding must do so carefully.  Since overriding can change how existing code behaves, they can easily break existing code and introduce bugs.  Since the client may not have access to the existing code behind the abstraction barrier, it is often tricky to trace and debug.  Furthermore, the implementer would not appreciate it if their code was working perfectly until one day, someone overriding a method causes their code to fail, even without the implementer changing anything in their code.

Unfortunately, this responsibility cannot be fully enforced by the compiler.
It thus becomes a developer's responsibility to ensure that any inheritance with method overriding does not introduce bugs to existing code.  This brings us to the _Liskov Substitution Principle_ (LSP), which says: "Let $\phi(x)$ be a property provable about objects $x$ of type $T$. Then $\phi(y)$ should be true for objects $y$ of type $S$ where $S$ $<:$ $T$."

This is consistent with the definition of subtyping, $S$ $<:$ $T$, but spelled out more formally.

Let's consider the following example method, `Course::marksToGrade`, which takes in the marks of a student and returns the grade `'A'`, `'B'`, `'C'`, or `'F'` as a `char`.  How `Course::marksToGrade` is implemented is not important.  Let's look at how it is used.

```Java title="displayGrade Method"
void displayGrade(Course c, double marks) {
  char grade = c.marksToGrade(marks);
  if (grade == 'A') {
	System.out.println("well done");
  } else if (grade == 'B') {
	System.out.println("good");
  } else if (grade == 'C') {
	System.out.println("ok");
  } else if (grade == 'F') {
	System.out.println("retake again");
  }
}
```

Now, suppose that one day, someone comes along and creates a new class `CSCUCourse` that inherits from `Course`, and overrides `marksToGrade` so that it now returns only `'S'` and `'U'`.  Since `CSCUCourse` is a subclass of `Course`, we can pass an instance to `displayGrade`:

```Java title="displayGrade with CSCUCourse"
displayGrade(new CSCUCourse("GEQ1000"), 100);
```

and suddenly `displayGrade` is not displaying anything even if the student is scoring 100 marks.

The example above shows that we are violating the LSP unintentionally. The object `c` of type `Course` has the property: `c.marksToGrade` always returns a value in the set { `'A'`, `'B'`, `'C'`, `'F'` }, that the method `displayGrade` depends on explicitly.  The subclass `CSCUCourse` violated that and made `c.marksToGrade` returns a value in the set { `'S'`, `'U'` }, breaking the assumption made by `displayGrade` and causing it to fail.

On the other hand, a new class `EasyCourse` that inherits from `Course`, and overrides `marksToGrade` so that it returns only { `'A'`, `'B'`, `'C'` } is safe to use.  It will not make cause any issue in with `displayGrade` even if `displayGrade` will never display `"retake again"`.

LSP cannot be enforced by the compiler[^1].  LSP violations do not usually result in compilation errors. The program type-checks successfully, but fails to behave correctly at runtime because the compiler cannot reason about semantic properties such as "what values this method is expected to return". 

The properties of an object, therefore, have to be managed and agreed upon among programmers.  A common way is to document these properties as part of the code documentation.  The key issue in LSP violations is not the implementation of a method, but the expectations that client code relies on. These expectations form part of the method's specification, even if they are not explicitly written in code.

[^1]: We can use `assert` to check some of the properties though.

## LSP Through the Lens of Testing

Another way to develop an intuition of the LSP is through the lens of testing. When we write a method, we may want to introduce test cases to check that our method is working correctly.  Since these test cases are designed based on the _specification_ of our method and not its implementation details[^2], passing test cases aligns with adherence of the LSP.

[^2]: The test cases we are describing here are known as black-box tests and you will encounter these in later courses at NUS. We will not go into any further details in this course.

Let's look at an example. We would like to model a restaurant booking system for a restaurant chain. Consider the following `Restaurant` class.  Every restaurant in the chain opens at 10 AM and closes at 10 PM, and has a singular method `canMakeReservation` which allows us to check if the restaurant is available for reservations at a certain `time`.  **The requirement given is that the system must be able to process a reservation during opening hours between 10 AM and 10 PM.**

```Java title="The Restaurant Class"
public class Restaurant {
  public static final int OPENING_HOUR = 1000; // Note: not a really good design
  public static final int CLOSING_HOUR = 2200; //       better to make these private.

  public boolean canMakeReservation(int time) {
    return time <= Restaurant.CLOSING_HOUR
        && time >= Restaurant.OPENING_HOUR;
  }
}
```

The method `canMakeReservation` returns `true` when the argument passed into `time` is between 10 AM and 10 PM.  Let's think about how we would test this method.  Two important edge cases to test are to check if the method returns true for the stated restaurant opening and closing hours.

```Java title="Testing Restaurant"
boolean testReservation(Restaurant r) {
  boolean res = true;
  int opening = Restaurant.OPENING_HOUR;
  int closing = Restaurant.CLOSING_HOUR;

  // Can make reservation between 10 AM and 10 PM
  for (int time = opening; time <= closing; time += 100) {
    res = res && (r.canMakeReservation(time) == true);
  }
}

Restaurant r = new Restaurant();
testReservation(r); // return true, therefore test passes
```

<!-- Note that these are simple `jshell` tests, in software engineering courses you will learn better ways to design and formalize these tests. -->

Let's now consider two subclasses of `Restaurant` namely `LunchRestaurant` and `DigitalReadyRestaurant`. Our `LunchRestaurant` does not take reservations during peak hours (12 to 2 pm).

```Java title="The LunchRestaurant Class"
public class LunchRestaurant extends Restaurant {
  private final int peakHourStart = 1200;
  private final int peakHourEnd = 1400;

  @Override
  public boolean canMakeReservation(int time) {
    if (time <= this.peakHourEnd && time >= this.peakHourStart) {
      return false;
    } else {
      return super.canMakeReservation(time);
    }
  }
}
```

`LunchRestaurant` does not take reservations during peak hours (i.e., 1200 to 1400). As `LunchRestaurant` $<:$ `Restaurant`, we can point our variable `r` to a new instance of `LunchRestaurant` and run the test cases of the parent class, as can be seen in the code below.

```Java
Restaurant r = new LunchRestaurant();
testReservation(r); // return false, therefore test fails
```

Sicne the test case fails, `LunchRestaurant` is not substitutable for `Restaurant` and the LSP is violated.  We have changed the expectation of the method in the child class.

Let's suppose the restaurant chain starts to roll out an online reservation system for a subset of its restaurants.  These restaurants can take reservations at any time, including outside of opening and closing hours.  We create a subclass `DigitalReadyRestaurant`, as follows:

```Java title="The DigitalReadyRestaurant Class"
public class DigitalReadyRestaurant extends Restaurant {

  @Override
  public boolean canMakeReservation(int time) {
    return true;
  }
}
```

Similarly, as `DigitalReadyRestaurant` $<:$ `Restaurant`, we can point our variable `r` to a new instance of `DigitalReadyRestaurant` and run the test cases of the parent class, as can be seen in the code below.

```Java
Restaurant r = new DigitalReadyRestaurant();
testReservation(r); // return true, therefore test passes
```

The test passes.  In fact, all test cases that require a restaurant to process reservation during opening hours will pass for both `Restaurant` and `DigitalReadyRestaurant`.  Therefore `DigitalReadyRestaurant` is substitutable for `Restaurant`. Anywhere we can use an object of type `Restaurant`, we can use `DigitalReadyRestaurant` without breaking any previously written code.

This depends intimately on the requirement that assumes reservations should only be made between 10 AM and 10 PM.  If we change this specification to include "not being able to process reservation outside 10 AM and 10 PM" then `DigitalReadyRestaurant` is no longer substitutable for `Restaurant`.  This will also be reflected by an updated test case below.

```Java title="Updated Test Restaurant with New Specification"
boolean updatedTestReservation(Restaurant r) {
  boolean res = true;
  int opening = Restaurant.OPENING_HOUR;
  int closing = Restaurant.CLOSING_HOUR;

  // Cannot make reservation before 10 AM
  for (int time = 0; time < opening; time += 100) {
    res = res && (r.canMakeReservation(time) == false);
  }

  // Can make reservation between 10 AM and 10 PM
  for (int time = opening; time <= closing; time += 100) {
    res = res && (r.canMakeReservation(time) == true);
  }
  
  // Cannot make reservation after 10 PM
  for (int time = closing + 100; time <= 2300; time += 100) {
    res = res && (r.canMakeReservation(time) == false);
  }
}
```

We can now rephrase our LSP in terms of testing. A _subclass_ should not break the expectations set by the _superclass_. If a class `B` is substitutable for a parent class `A` then it should be able to pass all test cases of the parent class `A`. If it does not, then it is not substitutable and the LSP is violated.

## Preventing Inheritance and Method Overriding

Sometimes, it is useful for a developer to explicitly prevent a class from being inherited.  Not allowing inheritance would make it much easier to argue for the correctness of programs, something that is important when it comes to writing secure programs.  The two Java classes you have seen, `java.lang.Math` and `java.lang.String`, cannot be inherited from.  In Java, we use the keyword `final` when declaring a class to tell Java that we ban this class from being inherited.

For example, to prevent `Circle` from being inherited,

```Java title="Final Class"
final class Circle {
    :
}
```

Alternatively, we can allow inheritance but still prevent a specific method from being overridden, by declaring a method as `final`.  Usually, we do this on methods that are critical for the correctness of the class.

For instance, to prevent `contains` from being overridden,

```Java title="Final Method"
class Circle {
    :
  public final boolean contains(Point p) {
      :
  }
}
```

## Recapping the `final` Keyword

We have now seen that the `final` keyword can be used in three places:

1. In a class declaration to prevent inheritance.
2. In a method declaration to prevent overriding.
3. In a field declaration to prevent re-assignment.

In fact, we can use `final` when declaring a local variable or parameter as well, to prevent re-assignment within the method body.
