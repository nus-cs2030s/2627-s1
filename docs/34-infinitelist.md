# Unit 34: Infinite List

!!! abstract "Learning Objectives"

    After this unit, students should be able to:

    - explain why an eagerly evaluated list cannot represent an unbounded sequence and how `InfiniteList` overcomes this limitation using lazy evaluation;
    - construct instances of `InfiniteList` using higher-order factory methods such as `generate` and `iterate`;
    - trace and reason about the evaluation order of `InfiniteList` operations, including `head`, `tail`, `get`, and `map`;
    - implement and reason about lazy transformations on `InfiniteList`, particularly `map` and `filter`;
    - identify design challenges in `InfiniteList` implementations (e.g., filtering, repeated evaluation) and motivate the use of abstractions such as `Maybe<T>` and `Lazy<T>` to address them.

!!! info "Overview"

    In earlier units, we learned how higher-order functions and lambda expressions allow us to build flexible abstractions over data. We also introduced lazy evaluation, using ` Producer` and `Lazy`, to delay computation until a value is needed.

    This unit brings these ideas together to construct an `InfiniteList`: a list that can represent an unbounded sequence of values. Such a structure cannot be implemented using eager evaluation, as attempting to generate all elements would never terminate. By using laziness, however, we can describe infinite sequences declaratively and compute only the elements we actually access.

## Preliminary: An Eagerly Evaluated List

We begin with an eagerly evaluated list not to propose it as a reusable abstraction, but to establish a familiar baseline. By contrasting an eagerly evaluated list with a lazily evaluated one, we can isolate exactly what must change when a list is allowed to be unbounded. 

Let's consider first how we can represent an eagerly evaluated, finite list, recursively.  

A simple way is to treat the list as a recursive structure, containing a `head` and a `tail`, with the `tail` being a list itself.  We have a special terminating list called `Sentinel` that we use to terminate the EagerList.

```Java title="An Eagerly Evaluated Finite List"
class EagerList<T> {
  private final T head;
  private final EagerList<T> tail;
  private static EagerList<?> EMPTY = new Sentinel(); 

  public EagerList(T head, EagerList<T> tail) {
    this.head = head;
    this.tail = tail;
  }

  public T head() {    
    return this.head;  
  }

  public EagerList<T> tail() { 
    return this.tail;          
  }
  
  public T get(int n) {
    if (n == 0) {
      return this.head();          
    }                              
    return this.tail().get(n - 1); 
  }

  public static <T> EagerList<T> empty() {
    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
    EagerList<T> temp = (EagerList<T>) EMPTY;
    return temp;
  }

  private static class Sentinel extends EagerList<Object> {
    Sentinel() {
      super(null, null);
    }

    @Override
    public Object head() {
      throw new java.util.NoSuchElementException();
    }

    @Override
    public EagerList<Object> tail() {
      throw new java.util.NoSuchElementException();
    }
  
    @Override
    public Object get(int n) {
      throw new java.util.NoSuchElementException();
    }
  }
}
```

Let's provide two factory methods called `generate` and `iterate`, that will populate our EagerList for us.

```Java
public static <T> EagerList<T> generate(T t, int size) {
  if (size == 0) {
    return empty();
  }
  return new EagerList<>(t, generate(t, size - 1));
}

public static <T> EagerList<T> iterate(T init, BooleanCondition<? super T> cond, Transformer<? super T, ? extends T> op) {
  if (!cond.test(init)) {
    return empty();
  }
  return new EagerList<>(init, iterate(op.transform(init), cond, op));
}
```

Let's now provide the standard operation `map` so that we can transform the items in the list.
The `map` method takes a lambda expression as the parameter, applies it recursively to every element in the list, and returns the resulting new list. 

```Java
public <R> EagerList<R> map(Transformer<? super T, ? extends R> mapper) {
  return new EagerList<>(mapper.transform(this.head()), this.tail().map(mapper));
}
```

We can also provide the `filter` method, that takes in lambda expression as a parameter and tests if each element in the list passes the test.  We return the list containing only the elements that pass the given test.

```Java
public EagerList<T> filter(BooleanCondition<? super T> cond) {
  if (cond.test(this.head())) {
    return new EagerList<>(this.head(), this.tail().filter(cond));
  }
  return this.tail().filter(cond);
}
```

We have the special `Sentinel` cases,
```Java
@Override
public <R> EagerList<R> map(Transformer<? super Object, ? extends R> mapper) {
  return empty();
}

@Override
public EagerList<Object> filter(BooleanCondition<? super Object> cond) {
  return empty();
}
```

The resulting list can be used this way:
```Java
EagerList<Integer> l = EagerList.iterate(1, i -> i < 10, i -> i + 1) // [1, ..., 9]
    .filter(i -> i % 3 == 0)                                         // [3,  6,  9]
    .map(i -> i * 2);                                                // [6, 12, 18]
l.head();        // 6
l.tail().head(); // 12
l.tail().tail().head(); // 18
l.get(2);               // 18
```

## An Infinite List

Lazy evaluation allows us to delay the computation that produces data until the data is needed.  This powerful concept enables us to build computationally efficient data structures.  We will focus on building a list with a possibly an infinite number of elements &mdash; something that couldn't be done without lazy evaluation.  Any eager-evaluation-based solution will just run in an infinite loop if the list is infinitely long.  For instance,

```Java
EagerList.iterate("", s -> s.length() >= 0, s -> s + "a"); // infinite loop
```

Just as we saw in the previous unit, we can delay a computation by using the `Producer` functional interface (or anything equivalent).  Instead of doing `compute()` which is immediately evaluated when executed, we replace it with a `Producer` `() -> compute()`, which "stores" the computation in an instance of `Producer`, and we only call it when we invoke the `produce()` method.

Instead of storing the head and tail of the list, we can think of an infinite list as consisting of two functions, the first is a function that generates the head, and the second is a function that generates the tail.  Our `InfiniteList` looks like this:

```Java title="InfiniteList v0.1"
class InfiniteList<T> {
  private final Producer<T> head;
  private final Producer<InfiniteList<T>> tail;

  public InfiniteList(Producer<T> head, Producer<InfiniteList<T>> tail) {
    this.head = head;
    this.tail = tail;
  }

  public T head() {             // be careful, the method name
    return this.head.produce(); // is the same as the field name
  }

  public InfiniteList<T> tail() { // same here, method name
    return this.tail.produce();   // is the same as field name
  }

  public T get(int n) {
    if (n == 0) {
      return this.head();          // be careful!
    }                              //   use the methods
    return this.tail().get(n - 1); //   instead of fields
  }
}
```

Note that we don't need a `Sentinel` for now.  We will need it if we have operations that truncate the list to a finite one, but let's not worry about it yet.

We now change the `generate` method to be lazy, by passing in a producer instead.  We no longer need to pass in the size, since the list can be infinitely long!
```Java
public static <T> InfiniteList<T> generate(Producer<T> producer) {
  return new InfiniteList<T>(producer,
      () -> generate(producer));
}
```

We can change `iterate` as well to only iterate through and generate the next element when we need it.  Note that we no longer need to provide the terminating condition `cond`.
```Java
public static <T> InfiniteList<T> iterate(T init, Transformer<T, T> next) {
  return new InfiniteList<T>(() -> init,
      () -> iterate(next.transform(init), next));
}
```

Here are some examples of how to use the two methods above:

```Java
InfiniteList<Integer> ones = InfiniteList.generate(() -> 1);       // 1, 1, 1, 1, ....
InfiniteList<Integer> evens = InfiniteList.iterate(0, x -> x + 2); // 0, 2, 4, 6, ...
evens.head(); // -> 0
evens.get(5); // -> 10
evens = evens.tail(); 
evens.head(); // -> 2
evens.get(6); // -> 14
```

Both the lists `ones` and `evens` are infinitely long, but due to lazy evaluation, we do not generate all the elements in advance, but only when an element is needed.  

## Map

Let's now write the lazy version of the `map` method as well:

```Java
public <R> InfiniteList<R> map(Transformer<? super T, ? extends R> mapper) {
  return new InfiniteList<>(
      () -> mapper.transform(this.head()),
      () -> this.tail().map(mapper));
}
```

The `map` method is lazy. All it does is create a new list initialized with a new lambda expression that applies the given lambda expression `mapper` to the head and the tail.

When we run:
```Java
evens.map(x -> x + 1);
evens.map(x -> x + 1).map(x -> x * 2);
```

We get an infinite list with elements 1, 3, 5, 7, etc, but the values in the list are not realized until they are needed, just like before.  Only when we call `head()` will we evaluate the lambda expressions and obtain the results:

```Java
evens.map(x -> x + 1).map(x -> x * 2).head(); // 2
```

## Under The Hood

This section explains how `InfiniteList` works at runtime by tracing the chain of `Producer` objects created by successive calls to iterate and map. The goal is to understand when computations are triggered and how values flow through a lazy pipeline. Focus in particular on how a single call to `head()` causes a sequence of deferred computations to execute.  It is thus worthwhile to trace through the code and understand how `head()` works.  For simplicity, let's put all our code together for easy reference.

```Java title="InfiniteList v0.2 with generate, iterate, and map"
class InfiniteList<T> {
  private final Producer<T> head;
  private final Producer<InfiniteList<T>> tail;

  public static <T> InfiniteList<T> generate(Producer<T> producer) {
    return new InfiniteList<T>(producer,
        () -> InfiniteList.generate(producer));
  }

  public static <T> InfiniteList<T> iterate(T init, Transformer<T, T> next) {
      return new InfiniteList<T>(() -> init,
      () -> InfiniteList.iterate(next.transform(init), next));
  }

  public InfiniteList(Producer<T> head, Producer<InfiniteList<T>> tail) {
    this.head = head;
    this.tail = tail;
  }

  public T head() {             
    return this.head.produce(); 
  }

  public InfiniteList<T> tail() { // same here, method name
    return this.tail.produce();   // is the same as field name
  }
  
  public T get(int n) {
    if (n == 0) {
      return this.head();          
    }                              
    return this.tail().get(n - 1); 
  }

  public <R> InfiniteList<R> map(Transformer<? super T, ? extends R> mapper) {
    return new InfiniteList<>(
        () -> mapper.transform(this.head()),
        () -> this.tail().map(mapper));
  }
}
```

Let's rewrite the statement
```Java
evens.map(x -> x + 1).map(x -> x * 2).head(); // 2
```

into something uglier and more verbose, but with intermediate variables to help us explain what happens when the statement above is invoked.

```Java
InfiniteList<Integer> evens = InfiniteList.iterate(0, x -> x + 2); // 0, 2, 4, 6, ...
InfiniteList<Integer> odds = evens.map(x -> x + 1); // 1, 3, 5, ...
InfiniteList<Integer> altEvens = odds.map(x -> x * 2); // 2, 6, 10, .. 
altEvens.head();
```

Let's look at what gets created on the heap when we run

```Java
InfiniteList<Integer> evens = InfiniteList.iterate(0, x -> x + 2); // 0, 2, 4, 6, ...
```

    ![evens](slides/figures/cs2030s-lec09-light/cs2030s-lec09-light.003.png#only-light)

The figure above shows the objects created.  `evens` is an instance of `InfiniteList`, with two fields, `head` and `tail`, each pointing to an instance of `Producer<T>`.  The two instances of `Producer<T>` capture the variable `init`.  The `tail` additionally captures the variable `next`, which itself is an instance of `Transformer<T, T>`. 

Next, let's look at what gets created on the heap when we run

```Java
InfiniteList<Integer> odds = evens.map(x -> x + 1); // 1, 3, 5, ...
```

    ![odds](slides/figures/cs2030s-lec09-light/cs2030s-lec09-light.004.png#only-light)


The figure above shows the objects added.  `odds` is an instance of `InfiniteList`, with two fields, `head` and `tail`, each pointing to an instance of `Producer<T>`.  The two instances of `Producer<T>` capture the local variables, `this` and `mapper`, of the method `map`.  `mapper` refers to an instance of `Transformer<T, T>`.  Since the method `map` of `evens` is called, the `this` reference refers to the object `evens`. 

After calling 
```Java
InfiniteList<Integer> altEvens = odds.map(x -> x * 2); // 2, 6, 10, .. 
```

We have the following objects set up.

    ![odds](slides/figures/cs2030s-lec09/cs2030s-lec09.005.png#only-dark)
    ![odds](slides/figures/cs2030s-lec09-light/cs2030s-lec09-light.005.png#only-light)

Let's now trace through what happens when we call `altEvens.head()`.  This method leads to the call `this.head.produce()`, where `this` refers to `altEvens`.  The call to `produce` invoked `mapper.transform(this.head.produce())` of the producer labeled 1 in the figure below.  This leads to `this.head.produce()` of this producer being called.  Within this producer, `this` refers to `odds`, and so `this.head.produce()` invoked `mapper.transform(this.head.produce())` of the producer labelled 2.   Now, `this` refers to `evens`, and `this.head.produce()` causes the producer `() -> `init` (labeled 3) to produce 0.

    ![altEvens](figures/infinitelist/infinitelist.004.png)

=== "New Figure"

    ![altEvens](slides/figures/cs2030s-lec09/cs2030s-lec09.006.png#only-dark)
    ![altEvens](slides/figures/cs2030s-lec09-light/cs2030s-lec09-light.006.png#only-light)

The execution now returns to the invocation of `mapper.transform(this.head.produce())` and call `mapper.transform(0)` (labeled 4).  This returns the value 1, which we pass into the `mapper.transform(1)` (labeled 5).  The `mapper` is `x -> x * 2` so we have the result 2, which we return from `altEvens.head()`.

This process shows a very different order of execution than `EagerList`.
If we run, 
```Java
EagerList.iterate(0, x -> x < 10, x -> x + 2)
    .map(x -> x + 1)
    .map(x -> x * 2)
    .head();
```

The method `iterate` generates all the elements first, then all the elements get `map`-ed with `x -> x + 1`, then with `x -> x + 2`, and then the first element is retrieved.  

When we run, 
```Java
InfiniteList.iterate(0, x -> x + 2)
    .map(x -> x + 1)
    .map(x -> x * 2)
    .head();
```

The method calls `iterate` and `map` only set up the producers that call other producers.  The call to `head()` is the trigger that causes the chain of producers to produce a value.

## Filtering A Lazy List

Filtering an `InfiniteList` is more subtle than mapping it. In an eagerly evaluated list, filtering naturally proceeds element by element until the list ends. In a lazy setting, however, neither the head nor the tail should be evaluated prematurely. A naïve translation of the eager filter implementation will therefore break laziness and lead to incorrect behavior.  The following naïve version does not work.

```Java
// wrong
public InfiniteList<T> filter(BooleanCondition<? super T> cond) {
  if (cond.test(this.head())) {
    return new InfiniteList<>(this.head, () -> this.tail().filter(cond));
  }
  return this.tail().filter(cond);
}
```

There are two things wrong with this.  First,  Line 3 `cond.test(this.head()` is eager.  It computes the head to test if it passes the given condition.  Second, Line 6 is eager, it produces the tail to recursively filter it.

To make `filter` lazy, we have to perform the test in the producer that produces the head. But if the test fails, we have to mark the head as filtered.

```Java
public InfiniteList<T> filter(BooleanCondition<? super T> cond) {
  Producer<T> newHead = () -> cond.test(this.head()) ? this.head() : null;
  return new InfiniteList<>(newHead, () -> this.tail().filter(cond));
}
```

In the code above, we use `null` to indicate that the `head` is filtered for simplicity.  It is not a good practice, however, since `null` could be a valid value in an infinite list.

Putting the abuse of `null` aside, the possibility that the head produces a value that is filtered affects other methods. The methods `head` and `tail` have to be changed to:
```Java
public T head() {
  T h = this.head.produce();
  return h == null ? this.tail.produce().head() : h;  
}

public InfiniteList<T> tail() {
  T h = this.head.produce();
  return h == null ? this.tail.produce().tail() : this.tail.produce();  
}
```

## Further Improvements

We have seen `Maybe<T>` as an abstraction that encapsulates a value that is either there or is missing.  Instead of using `null` to present a value that is not there, it is better to use `Maybe<T>` to encapsulate the value of the head.

Further, our implementation of `InfiniteList<T>` so far does not make use of memoization.  The same value keeps getting produced repeatedly.  We have built the class `Lazy<T>` that encapsulates a value that is produced on-demand with memoization to guarantee that it is produced at most once.  It is better to use `Lazy<T>` to encapsulate the value of the head as well.

We leave the construction of an `InfiniteList<T>` that uses `Lazy<Maybe<T>>` for its head as an exercise.
