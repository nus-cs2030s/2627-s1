# Unit 26: Unchecked Warnings

!!! abstract "Learning Objectives"

    After this unit, students should be able to:

    - explain why arrays and generics do not mix well in Java and how unchecked warnings arise;
    - interpret unchecked warnings produced by the Java compiler (`-Xlint:unchecked`);
    - reason about and justify (informally) the type safety of simple generic code despite unchecked casts;
    - use `@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")` correctly, minimally, and ethically;
    - explain what raw types are, why they exist, and why they should generally be avoided in modern Java.

!!! info "Overview"

    In earlier units, we learned that Java's type system helps detect many errors at compile time, preventing failures such as `ClassCastException` at runtime. Generics play a crucial role in achieving this safety. However, there are situations, especially when implementing generic data structures, where the compiler cannot fully verify type safety. In these cases, Java issues unchecked warnings rather than errors.

    This unit explores why unchecked warnings arise, what they mean, and how programmers should respond to them. We will see how type erasure, arrays, and raw types interact in subtle ways, and why the compiler sometimes has to rely on human reasoning instead of static checks. We will also discuss when (and when not) it is appropriate to suppress warnings, emphasizing both technical correctness and professional responsibility.

## Creating Arrays with Type Parameters

We have seen how arrays and generics do not mix well.  One way to get around this is to use Java Collections, a library of data structures provided by Java, instead of arrays, to store our items.  The `ArrayList` class
provides similar functionality to an array, with some performance overhead.  

```Java
ArrayList<Pair<String,Integer>> pairList;
pairList = new ArrayList<Pair<String,Integer>>(); // ok

pairList.add(0, new Pair<Double,Boolean>(3.14, true));  // error

ArrayList<Object> objList = pairList;  // error
```

`ArrayList` itself is a generic class, and when parameterized, it ensures type safety by checking for appropriate types during compile time.  We can't add a `Pair<Double,Boolean>` object to a list of `Pair<String,Integer>`.  Furthermore, unlike Java arrays, which is covariant, generics are invariant.  There is no subtyping relationship between `ArrayList<Object>` and `ArrayList<Pair<String,Integer>>` so we can't alias one with another, preventing the possibility of heap pollution.

Using `ArrayList` instead of arrays only _gets around_ the problem of mixing arrays and generics, as a user.  `ArrayList` is implemented with an array internally after all.  As computing students, especially computer science students, it is important to know how to implement your own data structures instead of using ones provided by Java or other libraries.  

Let's try to build one and to minimize confusion let's call it `Seq<T>`:
```Java title="Seq&lt;T&gt; v0.1 with getArray"
class Seq<T> {
  private T[] array;

  public Seq(int size) {
    this.array = (T[]) new Object[size];
  }

  public void set(int index, T item) {
    this.array[index] = item;
  }

  public T get(int index) {
    return this.array[index];
  }

  public T[] getArray() {
    return this.array;
  }
}
```

This generic class is a wrapper around an array of type `T`.  Recall that we can't instantiate a generic type directly (i.e. `new T[]`).  On Line 6, to get around this restriction, we instantiate (`new`) an `Object` array instead, and then cast it to an array of `T[]` instead.

The code now compiles, but we receive the following message:
```
$ javac Seq.java
Note: Seq.java uses unchecked or unsafe operations.
Note: Recompile with -Xlint:unchecked for details.
```

Let's do what the compiler tells us, and compile with the `-Xlint:unchecked` flag.
```hl_lines="1"
$ javac -Xlint:unchecked Seq.java
_.java:_: warning: [unchecked] unchecked cast
    array = (T[]) new Object[size];
                  ^
  required: T[]
  found:    Object[]
  where T is a type-variable:
    T extends Object declared in class Seq
1 warning
```

We get a warning that our Line 6 is doing an unchecked cast.  

## Unchecked Warnings

An unchecked warning is a message from the compiler that it has done what it can, and because of type erasures, there could be a runtime error that it cannot prevent.
They indicate that the compiler cannot prove type safety, not that the code is necessarily unsafe. The responsibility shifts from the compiler to the programmer.

Recall that type erasure generates the following code:
```Java
(String) array.get(0);
```

Since `array` is an array of `Object` instances and the Java array is covariant, the compiler can't guarantee that the code it generated is safe anymore.

Consider the following:
```Java
Seq<String> seq = new Seq<String>(4);
Object[] objArray = seq.getArray();
objArray[0] = 4;
seq.get(0);  // ClassCastException
```

The last line would generate a `ClassCastException`, exactly a scenario that the compiler has warned us.

It is now up to us humans to change our code so that the code is safe.  Suppose we remove the `getArray` method from the `Seq` class,

```Java title="Seq&lt;T&gt; v0.2 without getArray"
class Seq<T> {
  private T[] array;

  public Seq(int size) {
    this.array = (T[]) new Object[size];
  }

  public void set(int index, T item) {
    this.array[index] = item;
  }

  public T get(int index) {
    return this.array[index];
  }
}
```

Can we prove that our code is type-safe?  In this case, yes.  Since `array` is declared as `private`, the only way someone can put something into the `array` is through the `Seq::set` method[^1].  `Seq::set` only put items of type `T` into `array`.  So the only type of objects we can get out of `array` must be of type `T`.  So we, as humans, can see that casting `Object[]` to `T[]` is type-safe.

[^1]: Another win for information hiding!

If we are sure (and only if we are sure) that the line
```java
array = (T[]) new Object[size];
```

is safe, we can thank the compiler for its warning and assure the compiler that everything is going to be fine.  We can do so with the `@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")` annotation.

```Java title="Seq&lt;T&gt; v0.3 with @SuppressWarnings" hl_lines="5-10"
class Seq<T> {
  private T[] array;

  public Seq(int size) {
	// The only way we can put an object into array is through
	// the method set() and we only put object of type T inside.
	// So it is safe to cast `Object[]` to `T[]`.
    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
    T[] a = (T[]) new Object[size];
    this.array = a;
  }

  public void set(int index, T item) {
    this.array[index] = item;
  }

  public T get(int index) {
    return this.array[index];
  }
}
```

`@SuppressWarnings` is a powerful annotation that suppresses warning messages from compilers.  Like everything that is powerful, we have the responsibility to use it properly:

- `@SuppressWarnings` can apply to declaration at a different scope: a local variable, a method, a type, etc.  We must always use `@SuppressWarnings` to the _most limited_ scope to avoid unintentionally suppressing warnings that are valid concerns from the compiler.  In CS2030/S, we only allow applying `@SuppressWarnings` to local variables.
- We must suppress a warning _only if_ we are sure that it will not cause a type error later.  Note that suppressing a warning does not fix the underlying problem.  It only hides the warning from the compiler.  If we are wrong, we are on our own.
- We must always add a note (as a comment) to fellow programmers explaining why a warning can be safely suppressed.

Note that since `@SuppressWarnings` cannot apply to an assignment but only to the declaration, we declare a local variable `a` in the example above before assigning `this.array` to `a`.

## Raw Types

Another common scenario where we can get an unchecked warning is the use of _raw types_.  A raw type is a generic type used without type arguments.  Suppose we do:
```Java
Seq s = new Seq(4);
```

The code would compile perfectly.  We are using the generic `Seq<T>` as a raw type `Seq`.  Java allows this code to compile for backward compatibility.  This is anyway what the code looks like after type erasure and how we would write the code in Java before version 5.   Without a type argument, the compiler can't do any type-checking at all.  We are back to the uncertainty that our code could bomb with `ClassCastException` after it ships.

Mixing raw types with parameterized types can also lead to errors.  Consider:
```Java
Seq<String> s = new Seq<String>(4);
populateSeq(s);
String str = s.get(0);
```

where the method `populateSeq` uses raw types:
```Java
void populateSeq(Seq s) {
  s.set(0, 1234);
}
```

Since we use raw types in this method, the compiler can't help us.  It will warn us:
```
Seq.java:24: warning: [unchecked] unchecked call to set(int,T) as a member of the raw type Seq
    s.set(0, 1234);
         ^
  where T is a type-variable:
    T extends Object declared in class Seq
1 warning
```

If we ignore this warning or worse, suppress this warning, we will get a runtime error when we execute `s.get(0)`.

Raw types exists in modern Java for backward compatibility reason, and it could behave in an unexpected way.  For instance, if we have a generic type `A<T>`, then `A` $<:$ `A<T>` and `A<T>` $<:$ `A`.

Raw types must not be used in your code, ever.  For now, the only exception to this rule is using it as an operand of the `instanceof` operator.  Since `instanceof` checks for runtime type and type arguments have been erased, we can only use the `instanceof` operator on raw types.  We will remove this allowance after we introduce wildcards in later units.

To avoid having raw types, we can ask the compiler to remind us if we accidentally use raw types in our code with the flag `-Xlint:rawtypes`.

```hl_lines="1"
$ javac -Xlint:unchecked -Xlint:rawtypes Seq.java
_.java:_: warning: [rawtypes] found raw type: Seq
    Seq s = new Seq(4);
    ^
  missing type arguments for generic class Seq<T>
  where T is a type-variable:
    T extends Object declared in class Seq
_.java:_: warning: [rawtypes] found raw type: Seq
    Seq s = new Seq(4);
                ^
  missing type arguments for generic class Seq<T>
  where T is a type-variable:
    T extends Object declared in class Seq
_.java:_: warning: [rawtypes] found raw type: Seq
  public static void populateSeq(Seq s) {
                                 ^
  missing type arguments for generic class Seq<T>
  where T is a type-variable:
    T extends Object declared in class Seq
_.java:_: warning: [unchecked] unchecked call to set(int,T) as a member of the raw type Seq
    s.set(0, 1234);
         ^
  where T is a type-variable:
    T extends Object declared in class Seq
4 warnings
```
