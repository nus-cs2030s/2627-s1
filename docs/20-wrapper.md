# Unit 20: Wrapper Class

!!! abstract "Learning Objectives"

    After this unit, students should be able to:

    - explain why primitive types cannot be used with polymorphic code written over `Object`;
    - identify the wrapper class corresponding to each Java primitive type;
    - use wrapper classes to adapt primitive values for APIs that expect reference types;
    - explain and predict when Java performs auto-boxing and auto-unboxing;
    - reason about the performance implications of using wrapper classes versus primitive types.

!!! info "Overview"

    In earlier units, we learned how polymorphism allows us to write general code that operates over many different reference types using a common supertype such as Object. This flexibility, however, comes with a limitation: Java's primitive types do not participate in inheritance and therefore cannot be treated as Objects.

    In this unit, we examine how Java bridges this gap using wrapper classes. Wrapper classes allow primitive values to be represented as objects, making it possible to reuse polymorphic code and standard library APIs. We will also see how Java hides some of this complexity through auto-boxing and unboxing, and why this convenience comes with performance costs.

    Understanding wrapper classes is essential for working with generic code, collections, and Java's standard libraries, where the distinction between primitive types and reference types becomes unavoidable.

## Writing General Code for Primitive Types

We have seen the following general code that takes in an array of `Object` objects and searches if another object `obj` is in the given `array`.

```Java title="contains v0.1 with Polymorphism"
boolean contains(Object[] array, Object obj) {
  for (Object curr : array) {
    if (curr.equals(obj)) {
      return true;
    }
  }
  return false;
}
```

Through polymorphism and overriding of the `equals` method, we can make sure that it is general enough to work on any reference type.  But what about primitive types?  Do we need to write a separate function for each primitive type, like this?

```Java title="contains v0.4 for int"
boolean contains(int[] array, int obj) {
  for (int curr : array) {
    if (curr == obj) {
      return true;
    }
  }
  return false;
}
```

## Making Primitive Types Less Primitive

Java provides wrapper classes for each of its primitive types.  A _wrapper class_ is a class that encapsulates a primitive value as an object.  The wrapper class for `int` is called `Integer`, for `double` is called `Double`, etc. There is a wrapper class for all of the Java primitives.

| Primitive | Wrapper     |
|-----------|-------------|
| `byte`    | `Byte`      |
| `short`   | `Short`     |
| `int`     | `Integer`   |
| `long`    | `Long`      |
| `float`   | `Float`     |
| `double`  | `Double`    |
| `char`    | `Character` |
| `boolean` | `Boolean`   |

 A wrapper class can be used just like every other class in Java and behave just like every other class in Java.  In particular, they are reference types, their instances can be created with `new` and stored on the heap, etc.  

For instance,

```java title="Using Wrapper Class with Explicit Conversion"
Integer i = Integer.valueOf(4);
int j = i.intValue();
```

The code snippet above shows how we can convert a primitive `int` value to a wrapper instance `i` of type `Integer`, and how the `intValue` method can retrieve the `int` value from an `Integer` instance.  

By using wrapper types, we can reuse our `contains` method that takes in an `Object` array as a parameter to operate on an array of integers &mdash; we just need to pass our integers into the method in an `Integer` array instead of an `int` array.

All primitive wrapper class objects are _immutable_ &mdash; once you create an object, it cannot be changed.

## Auto-boxing and Unboxing

As conversion back-and-forth between a primitive type and its wrapper class is pretty common, Java provides a feature called auto-boxing/unboxing to perform type conversion between a primitive type and its wrapper class.

For instance,
```java title="Auto-Boxing and Unboxing"
Integer i = 4;
int j = i;
```

The first statement is an example of auto-boxing, where the primitive value `int` of 4 is converted into an instance of `Integer`.  The second statement performs auto-unboxing, extracting the `int` value from the `Integer` object. 

## Performance

Since the wrapper classes allow us to write flexible programs, why not use them all the time and forget about primitive types?

The answer: _performance_. Because using an object comes with the cost of allocating memory for the object on the heap and then deallocating the memory eventually, it is less efficient than primitive types.   

Consider the following two programs:

```Java title="Loop with Wrapper Classes"
Double sum = 0.0;
for (Integer i = 0; i < Integer.MAX_VALUE; i++) {
  sum += i;
}
```

vs.

```Java title="Loop with Primitive Types"
double sum = 0.0;
for (int i = 0; i < Integer.MAX_VALUE; i++) {
  sum += i;
}
```

As all primitive wrapper class objects are immutable, every time the sum in the first example above is updated, a new `Double` object gets created. 

Auto-boxing and unboxing happen implicitly, which makes code concise but also makes object creation less visible. As a result, performance issues can arise even when the code appears to use only simple arithmetic.

To address such performance issues, the Java API provides multiple versions of the same method, one for all the reference types using `Object`, and one for each of the primitive types.  This decision does lead to multiple versions of the same code, but this trade-off comes with the benefit of better performance.  See the [Arrays](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/25/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Arrays.html) class for instance.

The separation between primitive types and their wrapper classes is a legacy design choice in Java.  Wrapper classes and auto-boxing were introduced later to improve interoperability without breaking existing code.

## Equality

When comparing two primitive values, we use the `==` operator.  When comparing two reference types, we usually use the `equals` method.  What about comparing two wrapper class objects?

When comparing two wrapper class objects, we should always use the `equals` method to compare their values.  Using the `==` operator will compare their references instead of their values, which is usually not what we want.

```Java
Integer a = 500;
Integer b = 500;
a == b   // false
a.equals(b) // true
```

This difference does not arise with primitive types and is a common source of bugs.
